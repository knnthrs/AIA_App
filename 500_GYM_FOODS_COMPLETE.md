### **If Asked: "Where did you get food data?"**

**Perfect Answer:**
> "We created a curated database of 500 essential gym and fitness foods using USDA FoodData Central nutrition information. Rather than using a generic food API that includes everything from candy to exotic foods, we specifically selected foods that gym-goers actually eat - high-protein sources, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fitness supplements. This ensures our users see relevant, goal-oriented nutrition options that support their fitness journey."

### **Key Points to Mention:**
- ✅ **500 curated foods** (not random selection)
- ✅ **Gym-specific** (proteins, pre/post workout, etc.)
- ✅ **USDA verified** nutrition data
- ✅ **Goal-filtered** for personalization
