# 🎯 HYBRID WARM-UP - SMART FILTERING (FIXED!)

## ✅ YOUR ISSUE SOLVED!

**Problem**: "Seeing fallback because database doesn't label exercises as 'warm-up' or 'stretching'"

**Solution**: **Smart filtering** - looks at exercise CHARACTERISTICS (body parts, movement patterns) instead of just names!

---

## 🔄 How It Works NOW

```
1. Filter to bodyweight exercises only
   ↓
2. Smart Selection (looks at characteristics):
   - Cardio-like: Full body movements, dynamic
   - Stretch-like: Single joint, range of motion
   - Activation-like: Compound moves, matches workout
   ↓
3. Found 3+ exercises?
   ├─ YES → Use database (HAS GIFs!) ✅
   └─ NO → Use universal (reliable)
```

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### OLD Approach (Too Strict)
```
❌ Required exercises named:
   "jumping jacks", "arm circles", "leg swings"
❌ Keyword matching only
❌ Missed most database exercises
```

### NEW Approach (Smart!)
```
✅ Looks at exercise characteristics:
   - Body parts targeted
   - Movement type (dynamic vs static)
   - Equipment (bodyweight only)
   - Compound vs isolation
✅ Selects exercises that WORK AS warm-ups
✅ Finds exercises in your database!
```
